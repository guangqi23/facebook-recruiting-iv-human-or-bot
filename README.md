# Introduction
In this Jupyter notebook, I present my approach to the recent Kaggle competition, [Facebook Recruiting IV: Human or Robot?](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot). 

# Problem
For this competition, we will be chasing down robots for an online auction site. Human bidders on the site are becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to win auctions vs their software-controlled counterparts. Goal of this competition is to identify online auction bids that are placed by bots, helping the site owners to easily flag these users for removal from their site to prevent unfair auction activity.
